# scbd-angularjs-controls
A collection of AngularJS form controls used in SCBD projects.


A set of Angular Directives for basic form controls and sometimes more advanced form controls.

Note: currently you need to make sure /templates points to your scbd-angularjs-controls/templates,
or angular well freeze, because it can't find the templates.
